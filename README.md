HiðŸ™‚, I intend to post ML code for all gym environments from [openai](https://gym.openai.com/ "gym.openai.com/"), I am not yet sure how. Stay tuned if you are interested.
I will be using pytorch library, read more about them: [Here](https://pytorch.org/ "Pytorch's official website")

General dependencies(off the top of my head):
```
pip install numpy
pip install gym
pip install torch
```

Each of the folders will have its README.md with details.

Feel free to raise an issue if you run into  problems.


PS. All code is cpu(torch) compatible only (I don't own a graphics card).
